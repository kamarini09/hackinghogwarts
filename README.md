Hacked Hogwarts Student List

This is a final assignment for learning vanilla JavaScript. It involves building a system to help the administrators at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry handle student lists, starting with the infamous class of 1991.

User Requirements
The solution should allow administrators to:

View a list of students, including their first, middle, and last names, and sort/filter them by name or house.
Search for a student by first or last name.
View details about a student, including their photo, house crest and colors, blood-status, and whether they are a prefect or part of the inquisitorial squad.
Expel a student, removing them from the list and adding them to a separate list of expelled students.
Appoint two students from each house as prefects and revoke their prefect status.
Implement racial profiling by adding "blood-status" to each student based on family names.
Infiltrate the system by adding yourself as a student, removing students from the inquisitorial squad, and messing up the pure-blood algorithm.

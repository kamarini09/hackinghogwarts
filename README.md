<h1>Hacked Hogwarts Student List</h1>

<p>This is a final assignment of the Just JavaScript theme at KEA.The purpose was to code in Vanilla JavaScript so we learn the basics,starting from the fundamental concepts and building up to more complex topics. It covers topics such as variables, data types, operators, functions, loops, and objects.  By the end of the theme, I had a good understanding of JavaScript and I was able to build basic web applications and interact with APIs.

<p>This project involves building a system to help the administrators at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry handle student lists. It is a practical example of how to use JavaScript to solve a real-world problem and is designed to consolidate the knowledge gained throughout the theme.

<h3>User Requirements
<br>

The solution should allow administrators to:

<ul>
<li>View a list of students, including their first, middle, and last names, and sort/filter them by name or house.
<li>Search for a student by first or last name.
<li>View details about a student, including their photo, house crest and colors, blood-status, and whether they are a prefect or part of the inquisitorial squad.
<li>Expel a student, removing them from the list and adding them to a separate list of expelled students.
<li>Appoint two students from each house as prefects and revoke their prefect status.
<li>Implement racial profiling by adding "blood-status" to each student based on family names.
<li>Infiltrate the system by adding yourself as a student, removing students from the inquisitorial squad, and messing up the pure-blood algorithm.

</ul>

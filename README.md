<h1>Hacked Hogwarts Student List</h1>

<p>This is a final assignment of the Just JavaScript theme at KEA.The purpose was to code in Vanilla JavaScript so we learn the basics,starting from the fundamental concepts and building up to more complex topics. It covers topics such as variables, data types, operators, functions, loops, and objects.  By the end of the theme, I had a good understanding of JavaScript and I was able to build basic web applications and interact with APIs.

<p>This project involves building a system to help the administrators at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry handle student lists. It is a practical example of how to use JavaScript to solve a real-world problem and is designed to consolidate the knowledge gained throughout the theme.
